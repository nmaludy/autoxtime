# Current
- Move the "import" inserts into the "save" button on the event, rather than the import.
- changing event in registration window

# Timing
- Global "current" event
  - update protobuf
  - update database
  - remove Event combo box from Registration window
  - Registraton widget should subscribe to "event" events so when current changes, we can switch
  - Show current event in the top bar next to icon
  - maybe some sort of like singleton function/class we can read-from/subscribe-to for current event?
